/**
 Weight design:
 
 Each course's component starts off at a 5000 weighting
 
 Each course component's weight gets subtracted by the formula x^1.2 where x is the number of minutes from 8:30am
 
 A course component that goes into the 12:00-1:00pm block is subtracted 800 weighting points
 
 A course component gets 300/60 * x added to it's weighting, where x is number of minutes the component consumes
 
 The final weighting is subtracted by log_10(x)*1000, where x is the number of sections the course has
 
 If a component section has multiple classes, weight each one, then find the mean
 
 If a class is taught by Quazi Rahman, it gets added a 5000 weighting
