# Timetable Optimizer

This project is designed to create the optimal timetable, given a list of courses inside the program, and a set of rules written in the code.

## Installation

This is a Python project slowly being converted to a C++ project. Set it up however you wish, as long as all the project files stay in the same folder.

## Usage

Write your rules in the weight_* functions (see its current contents for an exmaple), compile (if necessary) and run.

Warning: it can take a while if you have lots of courses.
